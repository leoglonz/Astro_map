This repository contains the bulk of code used in the analysis of stellar feedback-driven outflows started Fall of 2021. (Currently active). The work here is an extension of computational analysis conducted by Professor Christensen, Hollis Akins, et al., which has been directed to understand galactic star formation quenching in the low-mass, dwarf/satellite regime. This extension of their analysis uses the 'DC Justice League Suite' of cosmological, hydrodynamic simulations constructed with Charm N-body Gravity solver (ChaNGa) and prepared by Ferah Munshi (University of Oklahoma) et al. Equipped with these simulations, the computations here take specific aim at gas particles stripped from satellites that have been heated by supernovae (stellar feedback), and is motivated by a desire to understand how such feedback effects, if at all, contribute to satellite quenching, if they aid generally excepted modes of quenching (i.e., ram pressure stripping, tidal stripping), and how they impact satellite morphology.

Note that the datasets used for this study are not included here for sake of their larger sizes, but can be found on Quirm (@grinnell.mathlan) via `/home/lonzaric/astro_research/Stellar_Feedback_Code/SNeData/`.
